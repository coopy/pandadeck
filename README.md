Panda Deck
==========

Create and share decks of flash cards!

Installation
------------
```
git clone https://github.com/per-nilsson/pandadeck
npm i
npm start
```

TODO
----
- LocalstorageCollection needs to disambiguate between models that belong to
  different collections with the same namespace.
- Clicking an existing card in a deck should open edit mode.
- Flashing mode styles needs love.
- Create a nice swipe interaction for turning over a flash card.
